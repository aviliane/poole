<h1>About Us</h1>
The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, formerly the Womenâ€™s Student Assembly (WSA), is one of eight assemblies within the Programming Branch of the Undergraduate Student Government at USC. SAGE was founded by women who sought to create change around issues that women faced. As an organization, SAGE has grown and expanded our focus. Inspired by feminists and powered by students, SAGE works on and off campus to address feminist issues, to engage the community, and to empower those oppressed by the patriarchy.
<br><br>
The mission of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment is to address the emerging concerns of USC students oppressed under the patriarchy by working to strengthen the network of feminist and ally identifying students, faculty, staff, and organizations. With a network of diverse organizations and a proactive stance in sponsoring political, educational, social, and community events, SAGE seeks to raise the awareness, impact, and voices of those oppressed by the patriarchy. The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment is a queer and trans inclusive organization working towards intersectional, collective liberation.
