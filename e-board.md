EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

Vanessa Diaz

vanessa

Vanessa Diaz is from Dallas, Texas. She’s a second-generation Mexican American, and is working on her Spanish by watching novelas. Vanessa is a big advocator for self-love, self-care, and body love. The journey to loving yourself is a power trip, but she asks you to be patient with yourself. She would very much love to see the dismantling of our capitalist imperialist white supremacist cisheteronormative patriarchy, but until that day comes, she will settle for taking selfies with puppies, cats, and squirrels. 

 

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Maddie Hengst

Maddie is a Public Relations major from Cleveland, Ohio. Her greatest accomplishment was sneaking two live turtles through TSA with her mom, and also publishing a research paper examining gender identity and linguistic practice in The Descent of Alette. She hopes to revolutionize the misogynistic field of advertising, but until then she will watch romantic comedies and talk about how much she loves Cleveland with obnoxious frequency.

Elisa Aprà is a vegan chef extraordinaire and a zine fiend, not to mention our rad director of graphic design! She was born in Torino, Italy, but grew up in Richland, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Fun fact: she hasn’t worn jeans in 4 years!! That’s commitment. She is currently an art major, but is hoping not to be by the end of the year. Elisa got involved with WSA because a bunch of people told her when she first got to USC that she would enjoy it, and they were 100% right!

She got involved with WSA to learn about feminism in a safe and judgmental free space and spread her womanist & #blackgirlmagic vibes across campus, which we think is pretty rad.
